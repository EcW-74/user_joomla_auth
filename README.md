================

The Joomla Authentication Backend is a user authentication against a Joomla user database. To define which Joomla user can login into the owncloud you need to create on the Joomla side a user group and assign the user to this group. On the ownCloud side the user group needs to be defined in the Joomla Authentication Backend configuration.
